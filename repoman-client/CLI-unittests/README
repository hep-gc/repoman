This directory contains the unit testing for the repoman command line
interface (CLI).  This is meant to be high-level testing (i.e.,
testing of the repoman script itself), as opposed to lower-level
testing (i.e., module or class level testing).

To run the tests, follow the recipe below:

1. Deploy the latest repoman client on your desktop.

   $ cd repoman-client
   $ sudo python ./setup.py install

2. Make sure your proxy is valid:

   $ grid-proxy-init

3. IMPORTANT: Make sure you point your repoman client
   to the development repoman server (vm129.cloud.nrc.ca).
   Do a 'repoman about' to verify this.

   $ repoman about
   ...
   repository_host: vm129.cloud.nrc.ca
   ...

4. Run the unit tests:
   $ cd CLI-unittests
   $ python cli-unittests.py
