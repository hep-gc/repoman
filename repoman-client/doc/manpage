.TH REPOMAN 1 "28 November 2011"
.SH NAME
repoman \- a command to interact with repoman Virtual Machine (VM) image repositories
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrepoman\fP help [\fIsubcommand\fP]

\fBrepoman\fP [options] \fIsubcommand\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Repoman is the name given to both a user command and a server software package that provides Virtual Machine (VM) image
repository management over the web (HTTP/HTTPS). This man page describes the command used to interact with a repoman server,
allowing you to create, manage, and delete Virtual Machine images.
.SS Options
.TP
\fB{-r|--repository}\fP \fIfully_qualified_host_name\fP
Override the configuration file default \fIrepository\fP setting with \fIfully_qualified_host_name\fP.
For example: "vmrepo.example.ca".
.TP
\fB{-p|--port}\fP \fIport\fP
Override the configuration file default \fIport\fP setting with \fIport\fP.
Defaults to 443, the default port for a repoman server.
.TP
\fB{-P|--proxy}\fP \fIpath\fP
Override the configuration file default proxy certificate path with \fIpath\fP.
Defaults to "/tmp/x509up_uNNNN", where "NNNN" is your effective UID.
.TP
\fIsubcommand\fP
See the following sections for possible subcommands and subcommand parameters.

.SH HELP SUBCOMMAND
.TP
\fBhelp\fP [\fIsubcommand\fP]
Show the help dialog. If no subcommand is specified, a general overview of all subcommands is displayed.
Specifying a subcommand displays information specific to that subcommand.

.SH CONFIGURATION SUBCOMMAND
Before other repoman subcommands can be used, a configuration file must be created. The following subcommand will create the
configuration file for you.
.TP
\fB{mc|make-config}\fP [{--exclude|-e} \fIpaths\fP]
.TP
{-E|--system-excludes} \fIpaths\fP
Blank separated list of paths to be excluded from a snapshot of the
operating system during a \fBrepoman save-image\fP. A directory path specification ending in \'/*\' will cause the directory
to be created in the saved image, but none of it's contents to be copied to the saved image.
Defaults to \'/cvmfs/* /dev/* /mnt/* /proc/* /root/.ssh /sys/* /tmp/*\'.
See note under \fBuser-excludes\fP.
.TP
{-e|--user-excludes} \fIpaths\fP
Blank separated list of paths to be excluded from a snapshot of the
operating system during a \fBrepoman save-image\fP. A directory path specification ending in \'/*\' will cause the directory
to be created in the saved image, but none of it's contents to be copied to the saved image.
Defaults to an empty list.
\fBNote:\fP The \fBsystem-excludes\fP and \fBuser-excludes\fP parameters perform precisely the same function. However, because certain specifications
are required to create a functional image, these specifications are established by default in the \fBsystem-excludes\fP parameter. It is recommended
that other exclusions be made by modifying the \fBuser-excludes\fP parameter only.

.SH IMAGE MANIPULATION SUBCOMMANDS
A VM image is a file containing a bootable copy of a configured operating system. In a repoman VM repository, an image is identified
by the owning user and a name unique within the owner's domain. In addition to the image itself, the repoman repository maintains
\'metadata\', or information about the image in a an image-slot within a database, for example: name, description, architecture, etc.
.TP
\fB{create-image|ci}\fP [\fIuser\fP/]\fIimage\fP [{--file|-f} \fIfile\fP] [--description \fIvalue\fP] [--os_variant \fIvalue\fP] [--os_arch \fIvalue\fP] [--os_type \fIvalue\fP] [--hypervisor \fIvalue\fP] [--unauthenticated_access {\fBtrue\fP|\fBfalse\fP}]
Create a new repoman image-slot based on the given information. If an image file is supplied, then \fIfile\fP is uploaded
to the repoman repository after the entry is created.

\fIuser\fP \- The image's owner. This may be omitted unless you want to create an image for a different user.

\fIimage\fP \- The name of the newly created image-slot on the repository. This will be used to reference the image when running
