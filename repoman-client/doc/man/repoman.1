.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrepoman\fP help [\fIsubcommand\fP]

\fBrepoman\fP [options] \fIsubcommand\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Repoman is the name given to both a user command and a server software package that provides Virtual Machine (VM) image
repository management over the web (HTTP/HTTPS). This man page describes the command used to interact with a repoman server,
allowing you to create, manage, and delete Virtual Machine images.
.SS Options

.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--port\fP \fIport\fP
Override the configuration file default \fIport\fP setting with \fIport\fP.

.SH IMAGE MANIPULATION SUBCOMMANDS
A VM image is a file containing a bootable copy of a configured operating system.
In a repoman VM repository, an image is identified by the owning user and a name unique within the owner's domain.
In addition to the image itself, the repoman repository maintains \'metadata\' or information about the image (for example: name, description, architecture, etc.) in an image-slot within a database.

.SH DUAL-HYPERVISOR SUPPORT
The repoman client and server contain logic to manage specially crafted VM images capable of running para-virtualized (pvm) under the Xen hypervisor and hardware virtualized (hvm) under the KVM hypervisor.   
Such an image is said to be a "dual-hypervisor" image.
This section discribes the requiements of a dual-hypervisor image and any special considerations associated with its use and management.

A dual-hypervisor image is a single file and must have the following attributes:

\(bu Contains a Master Boot Record (MBR).

\(bu Contains the GRUB boot loader images.

\(bu Contains a single bootable linux partition.

\(bu The linux partition must be formatted with a filesystem supported by the GRUB boot loader and given a valid f
ilesystem label. Partitions can be labelled with either the "mkfs" or "tune2fs" commands.

\(bu All booting and mounting of patitions must be via filesystem labels and not device names.
For example, if you have a bootable partition "/dev/hda1" labelled "/" and a blankspace partition "/dev/hdb" label
led "blankspace", then the following would be appropriate "/boot/grub/grub.conf" entries:
.sp
.na
        title Scientific Linux SL (2.6.18-308.8.2.el5)
            root (hd0,0)
            kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-308.8.2.el5 ro root=LABEL=/
            initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.18-308.8.2.el5.img
.ad
.sp
and
.sp
.na
            LABEL=/             /            ext3   defaults   1 1
            LABEL=blankspace    /scratch     ext2   defaults   1 0
.ad
.sp
would be appropriate "/etc/fstab" entries

\(bu The linux partition must contain the /boot, /boot/grub, /lib/modules directories, and any required swap files.

\(bu The /boot directory must contain all kernel images that may be booted either under KVM or under Xen.

\(bu The /lib/modules directory will contain a subdirectory for each bootable kernel which in turn must contain all kernel modules required by the associated kernel.

\(bu The /boot/grub directory must contain the following GRUB configuration files:

.in +3

\(bu A GRUB configuration file named "grub.conf-kvm" accessible by the GRUB boot loader and capable of booting a Linux kernel in a hardware virtualized machine running under the KVM hypervisor.

\(bu A GRUB configuration file named "grub.conf-xen" accessible by the GRUB boot loader and capable of booting a Linux kernel in a para-virtualized machine running under the Xen hypervisor.

\(bu The standard grub configuration file, grub.conf, should be a copy of one of the special purpose grub configuration files.

.in

The "save-image" function of the repoman client recognizes the structure of the running dual-hypervisor VM by the partition layout and by the presence of multiple hypervisor specific grub configaurations.
Having generated a faithful image of the environment, the repoman client will configure and upload multiple copies to the repoman server, one for each hypervisor environment.
For its part, the server maintains multiple copies of a dual-hypervisor image, each configured for its respective environment, serving the appropriate image upon request.

.SH FILES
.TP
~/.repoman/repoman.conf
This is a per-user configuration file. It can be created and maintained manually with your favorite text editor, or
via use of the \fBmake-config\fP subcommand.
